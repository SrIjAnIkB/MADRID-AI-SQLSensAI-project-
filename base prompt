I want to build a full prototype application named “AI SQL Optimizer” that automatically analyzes complex SQL queries, detects performance bottlenecks, and provides corrected/optimized versions. The system should allow users to paste an SQL query, optionally upload table schema/DDL or CSV metadata, and then receive an AI-generated optimization report. Use Python with Streamlit for the frontend and include an agent-like backend module for heavier tasks (OpenAI calls). The app should clearly categorize all detected issues (missing indexes, inefficient JOIN order, redundant table scans, SELECT * misuse, unnecessary subqueries, lack of filters, etc.) and immediately show a result panel with issues detected + recommended actions. Provide sample scaffolds with files, a demo dataset, and instructions. 
Keep the architecture modular and add a README explaining how to run the demo, how to swap in real database schemas, and how to integrate an OpenAI key. Use clean code. The UI must contain: (1) a text area for the SQL query, (2) an upload option for DDL/CSV, (3) an “Analyze Query” button that runs the optimization, and (4) a result panel that shows issues detected, missing indexes, suggested optimized query, estimated performance improvement, and JSON export. Add a small scoring system (0–100 Optimization Score) and a simple gamified badge for well-structured queries. Provide a “What-if Optimizer Simulation” so users can compare before/after queries. Add unit tests and a short demo walkthrough file.
